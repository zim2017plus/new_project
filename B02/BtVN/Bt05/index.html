            This blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, 
            including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted here first. You can also 
            follow the <a href="#">@reactjs</a> account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential 
            if you only read this blog.

            <h2>React Labs: What We've Been Working On - February 2024</h2>
            <p class="date">February 15, 2024</p>
            <p>In React Labs posts, we write about projects in active research and development. Since our last 
            update, we’ve made significant progress on React Compiler, new features, and React 19, and 
            we’d like to share what we learned.</p>

            <h2>React Canaries: Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta</h2>
            <p class="date">May 3, 2023</p>
            <p>Traditionally, new React features used to only be available at Meta first, and land in the open 
            source releases later. We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual 
            new features as soon as their design is close to final—similar to how Meta uses React internally.</p>
